                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Step 1.</strong><br>Rinse rice in a strainer or colander until water runs clear. Combine rice with 1 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until rice is tender, 12 to 14 minutes. Spread cooked rice onto a baking sheet to cool. Season with 1 tablespoon sesame oil and salt.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br>While rice is simmering, pour beaten eggs into a skillet over medium-high heat and allow to cook without stirring or turning to get a flat layer of cooked egg. When egg is completely cooked, remove from the skillet and set aside on a cutting board to cool.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Step 3.</strong><br>Separate nori sheets onto a flat surface and divide cooled rice between them, leaving only a 1/2-inch strip seaweed visible at the top of each sheet. Arrange strips of egg, cucumber, carrot, cheese, and ham in thin layers over rice.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Step 4.</strong><br>Beginning with the bottom of each sheet of nori, use a bamboo sushi mat to firmly roll each piece into a cylindrical shape. Brush each roll with 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and cut into 6 equal pieces.</li>
