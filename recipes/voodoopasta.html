        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Voodoo pasta</strong> is a bold and spicy Cajun-inspired dish packed with flavor and attitude. Typically made with blackened chicken, shrimp, or sausage, this creamy pasta features a rich sauce infused with Cajun spices, garlic, and sometimes a hint of heat from jalapeños or hot sauce. Bell peppers and onions add a sweet crunch, balancing out the spiciness for a mouthwatering Southern-style meal that's both comforting and exciting.
